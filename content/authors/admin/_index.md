I am currently a first-year graduate student studying [Quantitative Ecology and Resource Management](https://quantitative.uw.edu/) at the University of Washington. I graduated from the University of Notre Dame in May 2019 with a major in [Applied and Computational Mathematics and Statistics](https://acms.nd.edu/) and a concentration in Biological Sciences. I have enjoyed math my entire life, and I became concerned about environmental problems while in high school; my undergraduate research with [Dr. David Medvigy](https://biology.nd.edu/people/david-medvigy/) introduced me to the ways in which my interests could align. 

For fun, I enjoy running, watching college football, playing video games, and consuming superhero content.
